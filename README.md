# ductplanner

In essence, I would like to create a program that would read a pdf floorplan, recognize rooms, allow me to assign ASHRAE 62.1 room types to said rooms, determine a code-minimum required CFM for each space, and then as a select point A to point B across a hallways (for example), and select the boarders it should remain within, a duct main would be generated across that hallway that would decrease in size as a branch ductwork goes to each room.

This is most likely (definitely) overly simplied, and this project has a lot more steps than I can begin to imagine, but I guess that's the learning curve I've given myself for my first project... onwards!
